        "answer": "Our psycho-profiling methodology is based on peer-reviewed research and meta-analyses in experimental psychology with validity of 0.7-0.8 (correlation with real business results). AI is used to interpret profiles and generate recommendations, improving accuracy over time."

        "question": "How long does implementation take?",
        "answer": "Full implementation — 2-4 weeks. First week we digitize staff and set up integrations, second — train team and launch first dashboards. First results visible in a month."

      {
        "question": "How do you ensure data security?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How does personnel digitization work?",
        "answer": "Employees take tests taking about an hour: competencies, personality type, motivation. We use highly validated methodology confirmed by meta-analyses in experimental psychology. AI then interprets results into clear insights and recommendations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if the model makes a mistake?",
        "answer": "AI provides recommendations, but final decision always stays with humans. We show model confidence level and explain what data the conclusion is based on. Accuracy improves over time through feedback loop."

      {
